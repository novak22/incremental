# Changelog

## Unreleased
- BankApp now archives the last seven day-end ledgers and mirrors the shared activity log so the browser shell surfaces cashflow streaks without leaving the app.
- BankApp’s finance dashboard now pipes every tracked dataset—obligations, pending payouts, asset ROI tables, opportunity queues, and education commitments—into the in-app layout so the browser view matches the classic shell’s depth.
- ShopStack storefront replaces the legacy upgrades tab with a full browser app featuring category filters, product detail pages, and a My Purchases hub while reusing the original upgrade logic.
- Retired the debug action catalog and command palette overlays to streamline the shell and remove unused maintenance paths.
- Browser homepage ToDo widget now unifies quick actions, upgrade prompts, and enrollable study tracks in a single filtered checklist so only affordable moves surface.
- Browser homepage ToDo widget adds a "Focus on" toggle so players can sort for top-paying hustles, fastest upgrades, or an alternating blend of both.
- Learnly graduates into a dedicated browser app with a course catalog, detail pages, My Courses hub, and pricing FAQ while reusing the existing education systems.
- BlogPress brings the Personal Blog management flow into the browser shell with a table overview, detail inspector, pricing page, and one-click quality actions while reusing the existing passive-income logic.
- VideoTube graduates the vlog asset tools into a studio-style browser app with a channel dashboard, analytics view, niche selection, and launch workflow that reuse the existing vlog economy.
- Shopily launches as the dropshipping control center with KPI hero, store table + sidebar, upgrade shelf, and pricing tier cards while reusing the established commerce backend.

- Browser homepage redesign removes the sidebar, aligns widgets into a responsive three-column grid, and promotes the app launcher into tile-based cards with live status badges.
- Browser shell graduates to a multi-tab workspace: the launch page stays pinned as the first tab while apps like BankApp open in their own closable tabs and keep their state when you swap views.
- Browser launch view trims the hero headline, keeps repeatable quick tasks visible, and adds an inline End Day button when the action list is empty for faster wrap-ups.

- Browser shell entry experiments ship a homepage chrome with pinned sites and dedicated widgets while sharing the core game lo
op with the classic dashboard.
- Browser chrome now renders dashboard KPIs, quick actions, notifications, and the DownWork/VideoTube/ShopStack/Learnly surfaces through dedicated presenters that reuse the shared models.
- Modular UI view-model builders keep player overview, skills, header actions, and layout filters aligned while making alternate shells easy to drop in.
- Passive asset economy has lower upkeep, clearer payout ladders, and milestone callouts so builds pay off earlier.
