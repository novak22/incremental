## Entry Guidelines
- Keep the **Unreleased** section concise and remove items once a release ships.
- Give each dated release 3–5 single-sentence bullets that focus on visible gameplay changes or balancing headlines.
- Reference follow-up work with GitHub issues or pull requests only (for example, `[PR #456](https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/pull/456)`); skip commit links and essay-length commentary.
