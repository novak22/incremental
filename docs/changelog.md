# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Expanded the Micro SaaS quality ladder with an Edge-powered Quality 4 tier, fresh action gating, and UI messaging so late-game payouts highlight the Edge Delivery Network upgrade.
- Revamped the Education tab with accurate countdowns, celebratory badges, and tuition/daily load summaries so enrolling in a course feels clear and motivating.
- Replaced the static "End Day" button with a dynamic "Next" recommendation that fires the top asset upgrade or quick action, favouring longer time commitments before ending the day when no tasks remain.

- Centered the shell header around a "Daily pulse" band that highlights daily earnings and spend, lifetime cash flow, and the remaining versus committed hours for the current day.
- Expanded the hustle catalog with eight new instant gigs ranging from 15-minute surveys to asset-specific pop-up events, adding more scheduling variety and requirement-driven payouts.
- Grouped the asset detail slide-over into Active builds and Launch queue sections with scrollable stat strips, highlighting last payout, net hourly returns, upkeep, and inline upgrade shortcuts for every launched build.

- Reimagined the dashboard clock as a forward-moving 24h day tracker with colour-coded segments for sleep, upkeep, setup, and logged actions plus an at-a-glance legend.
- Rebalanced assistant upkeep allocation so helper hours are consumed before tasks bounce to the player, with overflow now failing when both pools are spent.
- Introduced schema-driven builders for hustles, assets, and upgrades so new content can be configured declaratively with shared UI details and metrics hooks.

- Added a net-per-hour ROI column to passive asset rosters and refreshed the instance briefing modal with asset-specific quality progress and upgrade actions.

- Recalibrated passive asset setup costs, maintenance, and quality payouts so Quality 3 earnings fall between $20–$40/day and take multiple weeks of upkeep to recoup, with documentation refreshed to match.
