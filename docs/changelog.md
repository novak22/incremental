# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Added a centralized action catalog with selectors plus an optional debug panel that lists availability, costs, and requirement gaps across hustles, assets, upgrades, and quality actions.
- Unified asset and upgrade requirement schema so unlock conditions share consistent evaluation and UI messaging.
- Revamped education tracks with upfront tuition costs, longer course lengths, and an automatic daily study scheduler that reserves hours until graduation.
- Added cinema/studio upgrade tiers and a three-step server infrastructure ladder culminating in a Cloud Cluster requirement for SaaS launches.
- Added instant hustles that reward active blogs/e-books, complete with live requirement summaries and one-hour payouts, plus per-instance cooldowns for high-impact passive quality actions.
- Added a net-per-hour ROI column to passive asset rosters and refreshed the instance briefing modal with asset-specific quality progress and upgrade actions.
- Replaced dormant passive upgrade buttons with inline "Support boosts" hints so category rosters call out the next helpful equipment or study unlocks.
- Added category-level asset rosters with upkeep, payout, and upgrade/sell shortcuts, plus an instance-aware briefing modal that surfaces owned and locked upgrades.
- Shifted passive asset payouts to credit during the morning maintenance sweep so earnings persist in the new day’s snapshot.
- Highlighted passive asset payouts in the Daily Snapshot caption and breakdown, including instance counts for each earning stream.
- Overhauled the passive asset board with stat-rich cards, upgrade shortcuts, per-instance earnings, and a briefing modal for nailing new launches.
- Replaced the tabbed workspace with a sticky header navigation that scrolls to each section, refreshed section styling, and removed duplicate passive asset cards.
- Major UI redesign with a collapsible daily snapshot, tabbed workspace, asset categories, filter toggles, and upgrade search for smoother planning.
- Shifted passive asset income to a day-driven scheduler with multi-day setup tracking and maintenance allocation.
- Added expanded asset catalog (Blogs, Vlog Channels, E-Book Series, Stock Photo Galleries, Dropshipping Storefronts, SaaS Micro-App) with per-instance state and dynamic income ranges.
- Introduced knowledge study tracks with daily commitments that gate advanced assets alongside equipment and experience requirements.
- Refreshed UI copy, card details, and styling to surface asset counts, income bands, and requirement progress.
- Reworked upgrades (camera, lighting kit, automation course) to align with the new asset ecosystem.
- Expanded the virtual assistant upgrade into a four-person team with daily payroll, hire/fire controls, and log messaging.
- Added cash-based maintenance costs for blogs ($2/day) and vlogs ($5/day) that block payouts when funds are unavailable.
- Wired a daily metrics ledger into the snapshot so time invested, money earned (with passive streams called out), and spending breakdowns reflect the current day’s actions.
- Introduced an asset quality ladder with bespoke actions, UI panels, and level-based payout scaling for every passive income stream.
- Added instance-level asset lists with one-click liquidation; selling pays three times yesterday’s payout and logs the cash in the new daily ledger.
- Recalibrated passive asset setup costs, maintenance, and quality payouts so Quality 3 earnings fall between $20–$40/day and take multiple weeks of upkeep to recoup, with documentation refreshed to match.
