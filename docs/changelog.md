# Changelog

## [Unreleased]
- Overhauled the passive asset board with stat-rich cards, upgrade shortcuts, per-instance earnings, and a briefing modal for nailing new launches.
- Replaced the tabbed workspace with a sticky header navigation that scrolls to each section, refreshed section styling, and removed duplicate passive asset cards.
- Major UI redesign with a collapsible daily snapshot, tabbed workspace, asset categories, filter toggles, and upgrade search for smoother planning.
- Shifted passive asset income to a day-driven scheduler with multi-day setup tracking and maintenance allocation.
- Added expanded asset catalog (Blogs, Vlog Channels, E-Book Series, Stock Photo Galleries, Dropshipping Storefronts, SaaS Micro-App) with per-instance state and dynamic income ranges.
- Introduced knowledge study tracks with daily commitments that gate advanced assets alongside equipment and experience requirements.
- Refreshed UI copy, card details, and styling to surface asset counts, income bands, and requirement progress.
- Reworked upgrades (camera, lighting kit, automation course) to align with the new asset ecosystem.
- Expanded the virtual assistant upgrade into a four-person team with daily payroll, hire/fire controls, and log messaging.
- Added cash-based maintenance costs for blogs ($2/day) and vlogs ($5/day) that block payouts when funds are unavailable.
- Wired a daily metrics ledger into the snapshot so time invested, money earned (with passive streams called out), and spending breakdowns reflect the current day’s actions.
- Introduced an asset quality ladder with bespoke actions, UI panels, and level-based payout scaling for every passive income stream.
- Added instance-level asset lists with one-click liquidation; selling pays three times yesterday’s payout and logs the cash in the new daily ledger.
- Recalibrated passive asset setup costs, maintenance, and quality payouts so Quality 3 earnings fall between $20–$40/day and take multiple weeks of upkeep to recoup, with documentation refreshed to match.
