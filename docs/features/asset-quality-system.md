# Passive Asset Quality System

**Intent**
- Quality ladders push players to invest time and cash into each passive build instead of only expanding breadth.

**How it works**
- Definitions declare `tracks`, `levels`, and themed `actions`; the UI renders progress bars, daily-use counters, and celebratory copy from that data.
- Daily payouts pull the current level band before applying modifiers like Automation Course or viral spikes.
- Quality actions log under the `quality` metrics bucket and broadcast milestone messages.

**Late-game extension**
- All six assets now reach Quality 5, roughly doubling previous caps (blogs ~$84/day, SaaS ~$220/day with supporting upgrades).
- Daily action limits prevent spamming and encourage rotating through multiple assets.

**Open questions**
- Monitor time/cash costs with more playtest data, especially for late SaaS.
- Explore automation perks or prestige bonuses for players running many top-tier instances.
