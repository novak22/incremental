# Passive Asset Quality System

## Goals
- Layer a clear quality ladder inside each passive asset so players balance breadth versus depth.
- Anchor upgrades to themed actions (posts, edits, bug fixes) that reinforce each asset’s fantasy.
- Surface requirements and actions on the asset card with upbeat, confidence-boosting copy.

## Player Impact
- Assets start at Quality 0 with minimal income until the player invests in quality actions.
- Spending hours (and occasional cash) on actions forces trade-offs against other daily plans.
- Each tier upgrade widens payouts, adds celebratory logs, and unlocks asset-specific perks.

## Key Systems & Tuning
- Quality data defines tracks, tier requirements, and flavourful actions per asset.
- Daily income draws from the current tier’s band before applying existing modifiers and variance.
- Asset cards host a Quality Actions panel with progress meters, gated buttons, and positive feedback.
- Quality efforts log time/cash spend and broadcast milestone messages when levels rise.

## Open Questions / Next Steps
- Tune time and cash costs once broader playtest data arrives (especially SaaS late-game loops).
- Explore assistants or upgrades that automate certain actions or soften requirements.
- Consider diminishing returns or prestige bonuses for running multiple top-tier instances.

### Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Quality tiers, tracks, and requirements defined per passive asset.
- [ ] Action costs, rewards, and log copy aligned with themed progression.
- [ ] UI shows current quality, progress, and disabled states for insufficient resources.
