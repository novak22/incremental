# Header Action Recommendations

**Purpose**
- Turn the header button into a friendly "do this next" guide instead of just "End Day".

**Behavior**
- Pulls upgrade recommendations first, then quick actions; both lists share the same availability checks as their panels.
- Sorts candidates by time cost (longest first) so chunky commitments win before cleanup tasks.
- Button copy becomes `Next: <action> (<time>)`; clicking runs the action. When no match exists we fall back to End Day.

**Player effect**
- Keeps priorities visible without opening more UI.
- Encourages high-impact actions before wrapping the day.
