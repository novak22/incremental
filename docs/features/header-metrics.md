# Header Pulse Metrics

**Purpose**
- Fill the shell header with the daily signals players check most: net cash, lifetime totals, and time pressure.

**What shows up**
- Daily earnings vs. spend feed from `computeDailySummary`.
- Lifetime totals use `state.totals` to track cumulative cash in/out.
- Remaining hours pair with already-reserved time so players know if thereâ€™s room for one more action.

**Player benefit**
- Net-positive or upkeep-heavy days are obvious without opening the snapshot.
- Long-term momentum stays visible even while scrolling away from dashboard cards.
- KPI buttons double as quick jumps into the matching dashboard sections so players can instantly review the detailed lists the stat hints at.
