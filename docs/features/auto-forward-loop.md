# Auto Forward Loop

**Purpose**
- Give players an effortless way to keep momentum without babysitting the primary action button.

**Behavior**
- Adds an "Auto Forward" toggle above the command palette trigger in the shell header.
- When enabled, the toggle presses the primary header action every two seconds, whether it's a recommended move or ending the day.
- The toggle highlights its active state, respects disabled buttons, and shuts itself off gracefully if the primary action becomes unavailable.

**Player effect**
- Supports idle-friendly play by chaining recommended actions automatically.
- Keeps late-game grinds feeling smooth while still allowing instant manual intervention.
