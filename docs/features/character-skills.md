# Character Skill Progression

**Purpose**
- Tie every action to long-term mastery without disrupting the day planner.

**Highlights**
- Ten themed skills (writing, engagement, research, visual, editing, commerce, software, infrastructure, audio, promotion) share a common XP formula: `round(hours × 5) + 1 per $25 spent`, minimum 1 XP.
- Skill tiers: Novice → Master at 0/100/300/700/1200 XP. Overall creator levels at 0/300/750/1400/2200 XP celebrate momentum.
- Education tracks award lump-sum XP for the disciplines they teach, so study days feel productive.
- Dashboard and education screens host the "Skill constellation" widget for quick visibility.

**Player impact**
- Instant hustles, passive actions, and upgrades now broadcast celebratory logs as skills grow.
- Aggregate creator level reinforces progress even when dabbling across many activities.

**Next hooks**
- Future perks or narrative beats can key off specific skill tiers.
- Consider temporary XP boosts from assistants or consumables once balance stabilizes.
