# UI Redesign Notes

**Purpose**
- Keep core stats pinned while letting players skim each pillar via smooth scrolling instead of tab swaps.

**Highlights**
- Sticky header carries daily meters plus jump links; the Daily Snapshot panel collapses but still lists time, cash, and study breakdowns.
- Filter toolbars let players hide locked/completed content and search the growing upgrade catalog.
- Passive assets and upgrades group into themed categories so large inventories stay readable; event logs offer quick summary vs. detail modes.

**Future tweaks**
- Persist filter preferences, add richer progress bars/iconography, and plan for mobile-friendly layout adjustments.
