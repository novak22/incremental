# UI Redesign Notes

## Overview
The workspace layout now mirrors the design brief: a clean dashboard that keeps vital stats visible while letting players dive into detail on demand. A sticky header holds the daily meters alongside a quick-jump navigation that smoothly scrolls to each activity pillar instead of swapping tabs.

## Goals
- Surface daily pacing information without overwhelming the player.
- Separate instant hustles from longer-term study commitments.
- Reduce passive asset clutter via categories and collapsed cards.
- Provide global toggles so locked/completed content can stay out of the way.
- Support growth of the upgrade catalog with grouping and search.

## Key Elements
- **Daily Snapshot Panel** – Collapsible wrapper with per-stat breakdown lists (time reserved, projected payouts, daily costs, study momentum).
- **Scrolling Workspace Navigation** – Header links highlight as sections come into view, encouraging players to skim every pillar without losing the context of their meters.
- **Filter Toolbars** – Global controls for hide locked/completed/show active, plus per-section filters (available hustles, active study tracks, collapsed asset view, upgrade search).
- **Categorised Grids** – Passive assets appear under Foundation, Creative, Commerce, or Advanced headers; upgrades live inside Equipment, Automation, Consumables, and Other buckets.
- **Event Log Toggle** – Summary/detailed switch keeps the recap readable during long play sessions.

## Future Considerations
- Add persistent user preferences for filter states via saved settings.
- Introduce iconography and progress bars to reinforce course duration and asset setup progress within collapsed cards.
- Explore responsive tweaks for mobile-first layouts once card interactions are optimised for touch.
