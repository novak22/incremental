# Venture Hub Redesign

## Goals
- Reframe the assets tab as the Venture Hub so players see it as their primary home base.
- Celebrate owned ventures with showcase-style cards, clear category theming, and trend badges.
- Reduce the visual weight of stat counters while keeping a quick-glance summary bar available.
- Make launching a new venture feel like a celebratory action instead of a utilitarian form.

## Player Impact
- Players now land on a hero summary strip that quietly surfaces total ventures, active runs, incubation count, and upkeep at a glance.
- Venture categories (Foundation, Creative, Commerce, Tech) gain iconography and warmer copy, turning each group into its own mini world.
- Each venture card highlights niche momentum, quality progress, payout breakdowns, and key metrics without overwhelming text.
- The floating launch tray turns discovering and starting new ventures into a rewarded moment with richer feedback when a build fires.

## Implementation Notes
- Rebranded player-facing copy from “Assets” to “Ventures” across the UI, dashboard callouts, and documentation.
- Introduced new CSS for venture summaries, category dividers, and card layouts that emphasize whitespace and consistent spacing.
- Added trend-aware niche badges, a padded metrics block, and modal-driven detail buttons to keep cards compact.
- Launch feedback and slide-over details reuse existing state helpers, so no gameplay balance was altered.
