# Browser Workspace Reference

## Overview
The browser workspaces now sit on a shared presenter foundation. ServerHub, VideoTube, and Shopily each instantiate `createAssetWorkspacePresenter` to wire up navigation, summary derivation, lock handling, and shared header scaffolding, while Learnly relies on the tab-oriented `createTabbedWorkspacePresenter` to coordinate its richer catalog flows.【F:src/ui/views/browser/utils/createAssetWorkspace.js†L1-L120】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub.js†L11-L292】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/createVideoTubeWorkspace.js†L9-L175】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/createShopilyWorkspace.js†L8-L218】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L1-L415】

Despite the shared presenter plumbing, most view renderers still build bespoke DOM to deliver tailored dashboards, tables, and card grids (e.g., ServerHub's app layout, VideoTube's dashboard/detail stack, Shopily's store grid, and Learnly's catalog and tab navigation).【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/appsView.js†L71-L149】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/dashboardView.js†L1-L118】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/detailView.js†L20-L52】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/dashboardView.js†L16-L172】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/views/catalogView.js†L5-L46】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/views/tabNavigation.js†L3-L35】

## Module Breakdown

### ServerHub Cloud Console
- **Presenter**: Composed with `createAssetWorkspacePresenter`, including launch CTA wiring and navigation badges.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub.js†L11-L292】
- **Views**: `apps`, `upgrades`, and `pricing`, exposed through the shared presenter’s tab list.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub.js†L270-L291】
- **State Fields**: `view` and `selectedAppId`, maintained through `ensureSelection` and persisted in presenter state.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub.js†L116-L126】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub.js†L216-L292】
- **Primary Handlers**: Launch confirmation, quick actions, and niche assignment are coordinated through dedicated helpers invoked by the presenter.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub.js†L99-L155】
- **Layout Regions**: The apps view pairs a KPI belt, table, and detail sidebar; upgrades render a bespoke card grid; pricing showcases plan cards with lifecycle copy.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/appsView.js†L71-L149】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/upgradesView.js†L28-L109】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/pricingView.js†L12-L73】
- **Bespoke DOM**: All three views hand-build their markup for metrics, tables, and CTA panels, preserving the original ServerHub visual treatment.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/appsView.js†L71-L149】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/upgradesView.js†L28-L109】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/pricingView.js†L12-L73】

### VideoTube Studio
- **Presenter**: Uses `createAssetWorkspacePresenter` with a VideoTube-specific header and selection guard to keep `selectedVideoId` in sync.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/createVideoTubeWorkspace.js†L82-L175】
- **Views**: `dashboard`, `detail`, `create`, and `analytics`, surfaced as presenter tabs (the create view remains hidden until triggered).【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/createVideoTubeWorkspace.js†L151-L174】
- **State Fields**: `view` and `selectedVideoId`, with `ensureSelectedVideo` demoting to the dashboard when no videos exist.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/createVideoTubeWorkspace.js†L31-L44】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/createVideoTubeWorkspace.js†L117-L175】
- **Primary Handlers**: Quick actions, niche selection, rename, and creation callbacks all channel through workspace-level helpers before invoking asset APIs.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/createVideoTubeWorkspace.js†L67-L115】
- **Layout Regions**: The dashboard combines a stats belt with a hand-crafted table, the detail view builds a renameable header plus panel grid, the creation card captures launch requirements, and analytics renders twin lists.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/dashboardView.js†L1-L118】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/detailView.js†L20-L52】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/createView.js†L4-L102】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/analyticsView.js†L4-L57】
- **Bespoke DOM**: Each view manually assembles its section structure to support custom styling and interactive behaviors like quick actions and inline rename.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/dashboardView.js†L1-L118】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/detailView.js†L20-L52】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/createView.js†L4-L102】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/analyticsView.js†L4-L57】

### Shopily Commerce Deck
- **Presenter**: Built on `createAssetWorkspacePresenter` via `createShopilyWorkspacePresenter`, layering in state reducers for dual selections and custom launch actions.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/createShopilyWorkspace.js†L13-L222】
- **Views**: `dashboard`, `upgrades`, and `pricing`, with tab badges tracking active stores and ready upgrades.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/createShopilyWorkspace.js†L197-L217】
- **State Fields**: `view`, `selectedStoreId`, and `selectedUpgradeId`, enforced by `ensureSelection` and reducer utilities in `state.js`.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/state.js†L1-L87】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/createShopilyWorkspace.js†L159-L218】
- **Primary Handlers**: Quick actions, niche selection, upgrade selection, and launch callouts route through helper callbacks before updating presenter state.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/createShopilyWorkspace.js†L43-L157】
- **Layout Regions**: The dashboard renders a hero band, store table, and detail sidebar; upgrades provide a status-aware detail pane; pricing cards reuse lifecycle summaries.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/dashboardView.js†L16-L170】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/upgradesView.js†L11-L193】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/pricingView.js†L1-L101】
- **Bespoke DOM**: Dashboard, upgrade, and pricing views remain handcrafted to support dual-column grids, requirement lists, and launch CTAs without generic widgets.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/dashboardView.js†L16-L170】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/upgradesView.js†L11-L193】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/pricingView.js†L1-L101】

### Learnly Academy
- **Presenter**: Powered by `createTabbedWorkspacePresenter`, with custom before/after hooks that hydrate a derived catalog context and sync complex tab state.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L1-L415】
- **Views**: `catalog`, `freeCourses`, `myCourses`, `detail`, and `pricing`, chosen through tab navigation plus presenter-controlled view switching.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L302-L371】
- **State Fields**: `view`, `tab`, `category`, and `selectedCourseId`, maintained in presenter state with guard rails ensuring valid course selections.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L17-L214】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L382-L508】
- **Primary Handlers**: Tab changes, category filters, course enrollment/drop, and course navigation update presenter state via shared handler closures.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L421-L505】
- **Layout Regions**: Learnly builds a hero with metrics, tab navigation, catalog grid with filters, detailed course panels, enrollment lists, and FAQ-style pricing sections via bespoke DOM helpers.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L254-L371】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/views/catalogView.js†L5-L46】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/views/myCoursesView.js†L1-L56】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/views/pricingView.js†L1-L40】
- **Bespoke DOM**: Every view composes custom card grids, lists, and tab controls to match Learnly’s education motif instead of relying on shared asset widgets.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L254-L371】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/views/catalogView.js†L5-L46】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/views/tabNavigation.js†L3-L35】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/views/detailView.js†L1-L160】

## Common Affordances & Deviations
- **Nav Tabs**: All workspaces expose view switching via presenter-driven tab buttons, with badges derived from model summaries (e.g., active assets, free-course counts). Learnly’s navigation remains custom, but still hooks into the presenter’s tab state.【F:src/ui/views/browser/utils/createAssetWorkspace.js†L20-L70】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub.js†L270-L291】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/createVideoTubeWorkspace.js†L151-L174】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/createShopilyWorkspace.js†L197-L217】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L302-L371】
- **KPI Grids/Bars**: Each module fronts key metrics near the top of its dashboard—ServerHub through KPI cards, VideoTube via a stats belt, Shopily with hero metrics, and Learnly through hero metrics aligned with study hours.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/appsView.js†L71-L149】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/dashboardView.js†L1-L38】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/dashboardView.js†L13-L168】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L254-L300】
- **Instance Tables & Detail Panels**: ServerHub and Shopily use tables plus detail panels, while VideoTube shifts details into a dedicated view and Learnly leans on card grids and enrollment lists instead of tabular layouts.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/appsView.js†L71-L149】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/dashboardView.js†L36-L168】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/detailView.js†L20-L52】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/views/catalogView.js†L5-L46】
- **Launch Dialogs/CTAs**: ServerHub still prompts with a confirmation dialog, Shopily and VideoTube surface launch/create CTAs inline, and Learnly’s enroll/drop actions update state directly with optional confirmations.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub.js†L99-L145】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/createShopilyWorkspace.js†L43-L80】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/createView.js†L29-L83】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L458-L505】
- **Module-Specific Deviations**:
  - ServerHub prioritizes action consoles and lifecycle pricing details to reinforce SaaS management beats.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/appsView.js†L69-L149】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/serverhub/views/pricingView.js†L12-L73】
  - VideoTube maintains unique flows for inline rename and analytics summaries tied to quality progress.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/createVideoTubeWorkspace.js†L101-L144】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/videotube/views/analyticsView.js†L4-L57】
  - Shopily leans on reducer helpers for cross-view selections and upgrade requirement formatting to support its store lifecycle storytelling.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/state.js†L1-L87】【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/shopily/views/upgradesView.js†L11-L193】
  - Learnly orchestrates a derived catalog context with hero metrics, category filters, and lock lookups to support education progression, standing apart from the asset-first modules.【F:src/ui/views/browser/components/learnly/createLearnlyWorkspace.js†L254-L508】

Renderer implementations can continue to lean on the shared presenters while evolving bespoke view markup where the experience demands specialized layouts.
