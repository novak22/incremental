# Hustle Expansion Batch

## Goals
- Broaden the daily hustle roster with bite-sized, equipment-driven, and technical gigs that bridge early passive assets with active play choices.
- Introduce more time variety so players can fill awkward schedule gaps with meaningful cash boosts.
- Reinforce asset ownership value by spotlighting scenarios where specific setups unlock premium payouts.

## Player Impact
- Players can plug 15-minute windows with the Micro Survey Dash or commit a half day to the Event Photo Gig, smoothing day planning.
- Asset owners feel their equipment investments matter: photo galleries, vlogs, dropshipping stores, SaaS apps, and e-books all open fresh cash spikes.
- Higher variety encourages experimentation with ROI filters and requirement chips while hunting for the perfect hour-to-dollar balance.

## Hustle Lineup & Tuning

- **Pop-Up Workshop** – 2.5h, $38 payout. Needs an active blog and e-book to sell blended learning experiences.
- **Vlog Edit Rush** – 1.5h, $24 payout. Requires 1 Vlog Channel to monetize editing chops for partner creators.

## Follow-Up Considerations
- Revisit ROI ordering after playtesting to ensure instant gigs surface intuitively across short and long durations.
- Evaluate delayed hustle diversity; a courier run or sponsored livestream follow-up could extend the new photo/audio loops.
- Monitor requirement chip UX now that more hustles depend on multi-asset ownership.
