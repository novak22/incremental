# Assistant Staffing System

**Purpose**
- Add a reversible workforce layer: spend cash to gain daily hours, and choose when to shrink the team.

**Current tuning**
- Up to four assistants; each costs $180 to hire, $24/day payroll, and grants +3h to the upkeep queue.
- Payroll processes before upkeep, so low cash can stall maintenance.
- Firing is instant, removing the 3h bonus and possibly leaving schedules in the red.

**Player takeaways**
- Assistants create an ongoing money sink that keeps late-game balances meaningful.
- Time routing now hits assistants first, then the player, making staffing choices impact upkeep reliability.

**Next considerations**
- Monitor ROI ordering in the upgrade catalog so assistant hires surface appropriately.
- Explore additional assistant personalities or automation perks once core tuning stabilizes.
