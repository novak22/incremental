# Day-Driven Asset Loop

**Purpose**
- Passive income advances on day boundaries the player controls, reinforcing planning over idle timers.

**How assets behave**
- Definitions specify setup days/hours plus upkeep hours (and optional cash). Setup reserves time at dawn when available; upkeep only runs when both time and money exist.
- Instances track status, days remaining, and last payout so logs and UI can explain success or stall states.
- Requirements span equipment, knowledge tracks, and owned assets; study hustles tick once per day and warn if skipped.

**Economy notes**
- Base payouts use per-asset variance (blogs low volatility; SaaS highest) with quality tiers lifting income.
- Recent tuning ensures early blogs/e-books cover their $3 upkeep soon after hitting Quality 1; Automation Course still doubles blog post progress.

**Player value**
- Daily stats call out which builds paid, stalled, or advanced knowledge, helping players adjust tomorrowâ€™s plan.
- Multiple instances per asset feel manageable thanks to inline status, maintenance funding, and requirement cues.

**Follow-ups**
- Add prioritisation controls when time is scarce.
- Keep monitoring late-game SaaS variance and Edge Delivery pacing.
