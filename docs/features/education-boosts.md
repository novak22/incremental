# Education Boosts for Instant Gigs

## Goal
Give study tracks a direct, satisfying payoff by letting completed courses raise the value of quick-turn gigs. The feature helps education feel like a strategic choice instead of a side quest.

## Player Impact
- Graduating from a course now adds either a percentage multiplier or a flat cash bonus to specific instant hustles.
- Cards for instant gigs and study tracks surface the relationship so players can plan their study queue.
- A celebratory log message highlights the extra cash earned when a boost triggers.

## Tuning Notes
- Multipliers stack additively (e.g., a +25% track makes an $18 gig pay $22.50).
- Flat bonuses add after multipliers so even low-base gigs feel worthwhile.
- Current pairings:
  - **Outline Mastery Workshop** → +25% Freelance Writing, +15% Audiobook Narration
  - **Photo Catalog Curation** → +20% Event Photo Gig
  - **E-Commerce Playbook** → +$6 Bundle Promo Push and +20% Dropship Pack Party
  - **Automation Architecture Course** → +$12 SaaS Bug Squash
  - **Brand Voice Lab** → +$4 Audience Q&A Blast
  - **Guerrilla Buzz Workshop** → +25% Street Team Promo and +$1.50 Micro Survey Dash
- Bonuses only apply after the course is fully completed.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Surface a compact tracker that lists all active boosts for the day.
- Let future upgrades modify the same table so players can spot synergies at a glance.
