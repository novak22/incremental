# Asset Niche Popularity System

**Intent**
- Give every passive build a flavourful specialization choice that gently alters payouts day to day.
- Encourage players to revisit instance management by pairing upkeep decisions with live market trends.

**How it works**
- Each asset instance can lock in one of five upbeat niches (cozy lifestyle, tech tinkering, indie creator diaries, mindful money, micro adventures) once it has launched.
- Niche popularity is stored in the global save file and drifts each dawn by ±15% with soft clamps (50% – 150%). The UI surfaces the top trends so players can glance at hot categories.
- Daily income rolls now apply the chosen niche multiplier and record it in the payout breakdown so logs and dashboards reveal how much hype helped.
- Players pick niches directly from the instance roster; once assigned the choice is permanent until the asset is sold.

**Player impact**
- Early game: gives a meaningful micro-decision after the first asset launch without overwhelming onboarding.
- Mid game: trend swings nudge players to diversify builds across different niches to smooth volatility.
- Late game: popularity summaries in the daily log become a quick signal for which portfolios might need attention.

**Open questions**
- Should future upgrades or studies unlock extra niche slots or the ability to respec older builds?
- Do we need prestige-era tools to auto-pick niches based on current hype when managing large empires?
