# BlogPress SEO & Backlink Metrics

## Goals
- Surface creative momentum stats when reviewing a single blog so players feel the daily grind shaping long-term outcomes.
- Track SEO reputation as an A–F grade so dips from new posts are obvious and wins from sprints feel celebratory.
- Persist backlink outreach momentum and translate it into a 1–5 rank that lines up with the quality ladder’s outreach requirements.

## Player Impact
- **Posts published** now appears on the BlogPress detail view, echoing how many long-form drafts the player has written.
- **SEO grade** starts at 30% (grade **D**) and swings whenever quality actions run:
  - Writing a post temporarily knocks the score down by 3–10 points.
  - SEO sprints usually raise the score by 7–15 points, though there is a 10% chance of a misfire that lowers reputation instead.
- **Backlink rank** counts every outreach push and maps totals to the requirements for Quality 1–5. The UI shows the current rank, link count, and the next milestone target.

## Tuning Notes
- SEO scores are clamped between 0 and 100 so unlucky streaks never feel permanent and hard-fought boosts stay meaningful.
- Outreach pushes add 1–3 backlinks; hitting the Quality 5 requirement (10 links) awards the full 5-star rank. Additional outreach beyond that rank keeps stacking toward future tuning passes.
- Existing saves without metrics backfill to the defaults (30 SEO, 0 backlinks) to avoid destabilising older playthroughs.
