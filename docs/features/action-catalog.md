# Action Catalog & Debug Panel

**Purpose**
- Keep every action (hustles, upgrades, quality pushes) in one schema so availability logic stays consistent.

**What exists today**
- Catalog selectors check time, money, requirements, cooldowns, and emit why an action is locked.
- A debug toggle (`?debugActions=1` or `#debug-actions`) lists the catalog in-game for rapid balancing.

**Why it matters**
- Shared data eliminates drift between cards, unlock messaging, and future recommendation UIs.
- Designers spot tuning gaps quickly because unmet costs highlight in the panel.

**Next steps**
- Expand filters/search for player-facing tools.
- Decide which catalog insights (e.g., “needs cash”) should surface directly on action cards.
