# Commerce Ladder Expansion

**Purpose**
- Give players a clear late-game path for growing dropshipping revenue beyond the base asset ladder.
- Encourage cross-play between storefront automation and the creative pipeline unlocked through stock photo studies.
- Keep upgrade requirements legible by tying each tier to active storefront counts and course completions.

**Highlights**
- Three-stage upgrade chain (Fulfillment Automation Suite → Global Supply Mesh → White-Label Alliance) now sits alongside server infrastructure upgrades.
- Requirements call for active dropshipping shops plus completed E-Commerce Playbook and Photo Catalog Curation studies, ensuring the ladder appears only when players are ready.
- Each tier layers cumulative payout multipliers and +1 quality progress on research/listing/ad actions, so investing in automation produces tangible daily gains.
- White-Label Alliance connects the commerce and creative economies, boosting both dropshipping payouts and stock photo promo progress once formed.

**Player Impact**
- Dropshipping veterans can reinvest profits into automation without micromanaging every storefront.
- Study completions matter after graduation—finishing both courses unlocks global partner networks and bundled media kits.
- Quality actions feel more explosive as each automation tier adds another progress pip, letting top-tier shops sprint to higher payouts.
- Stock photo galleries gain new life late-game, joining forces with commerce upgrades to sell pre-packaged branding kits.

**Follow-ups**
- Explore passive partner requests that appear once the alliance is active, granting limited-time payout bursts.
- Visualise upgrade chains directly on the dropshipping card so players can preview upcoming multipliers.
- Consider parallel ladders for other commerce assets (digital products, print-on-demand) that piggyback on the alliance perks.
