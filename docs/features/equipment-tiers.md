# Equipment Tier Expansion

## Goals
- Offer mid-game cash sinks that reward continued investment into existing content pillars.
- Establish an infrastructure ladder that clearly communicates when players are ready for SaaS deployments.
- Celebrate equipment upgrades with upbeat copy that reinforces progress and provides aspirational context.

## Player Impact
- Vloggers and photographers now have optional Cinema Camera and Studio Expansion upgrades that promise richer payouts and faster sessions once purchased.
- Server infrastructure progresses from a Starter Server Rack to a Cloud Cluster (required for SaaS) and culminates in an Edge Delivery Network for prestige uptime bragging rights.
- Equipment cards surface prerequisite messaging so players always know which upgrade to chase next.

## Tuning Notes
- Cinema Camera Upgrade costs $480 and requires the base camera before purchase. Studio Expansion costs $540 and requires the Lighting Kit.
- Server Rack - Starter costs $650 and unlocks foundational infrastructure. Cloud Cluster costs $1,150, requires the rack, and is the new SaaS prerequisite. Edge Delivery Network costs $1,450 and requires the cluster.
- All upgrades log celebratory flavour text and contribute spending data to the daily metrics ledger.
- Cinema Camera now doubles vlog quality progress, bumps daily payouts by roughly 25%, and adds a juicier viral spike chance at Quality 3.
- Studio Expansion doubles stock photo quality action progress and lifts gallery payouts by about 20% to offset the larger marketing pushes.
- Edge Delivery Network doubles SaaS quality action progress across all tracks and increases subscription payouts by roughly 35%.

## Follow-Up Ideas
- Explore prestige-tier upgrades that convert the doubled progress into passive automation for late-game scaling.
- Introduce maintenance costs or downtime events that encourage balancing infrastructure investments against daily upkeep budgets.
