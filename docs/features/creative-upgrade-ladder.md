# Creative Upgrade Ladder

**Purpose**
- Extend the creative gear path beyond camera and studio tools so established players have long-term publishing goals.
- Reward players who complete Outline Mastery and Brand Voice Lab with a new upgrade trio that keeps blogs, e-books, and vlogs scaling together.
- Clarify that automation, editorial, and syndication systems stack â€” each tier should feel like a meaningful studio milestone.

**Upgrade chain**
- **Editorial Pipeline Suite** ($360, requires Automation Course, 1 active blog, Outline Mastery complete)
  - Adds +20% blog and e-book income.
  - Adds +1 progress to blog posts, e-book chapters/covers/review pushes, and vlog quality actions.
  - Detail panel shows current active blogs and Outline Mastery progress so players see readiness at a glance.
- **Syndication Suite** ($720, requires Editorial Pipeline, 1 active blog & e-book, Brand Voice Lab complete)
  - Adds another +25% blog/e-book income and +20% vlog multiplier, plus +1 progress to relevant actions.
  - Unlocks cross-media copy explaining e-book and vlog dependencies with live knowledge progress readouts.
- **Immersive Story Worlds** ($1,080, requires Syndication Suite, active blog/e-book/vlog, both courses complete)
  - Adds +35% e-book income, +30% vlog hype multiplier, and +1 progress to e-book and vlog quality actions.
  - Details show active counts for each creative asset to reinforce the "all channels humming" fantasy.

**Player impact**
- Blogs retain their Automation Course personality but gain two more payout jumps that keep ad revenue competitive into late game.
- E-books move from a single Outline Mastery gate to a multi-upgrade runway that accelerates chapters, covers, and review pushes when purchased.
- Vlogs now have reasons to keep investing post-Cinema Camera thanks to larger multipliers, higher viral ceilings, and faster quality work.
- Upgrade cards surface knowledge progress (Outline Mastery, Brand Voice Lab) and active asset counts so requirements feel transparent.

**Tuning notes**
- Multipliers were chosen so stacked boosts roughly double payouts across the trio without eclipsing infrastructure upgrades.
- Progress bumps ensure late-tier quality goals remain reachable with reasonable day budgets after automation and syndication.
- Tests cover upgrade availability, payout stacking, and detail rendering to guard against regressions as new creative systems arrive.

**Next ideas**
- Introduce PR-tour events or limited-run collaborations that trigger once Immersive Story Worlds is owned.
- Explore a prestige "Story Bible" upgrade that adds a passive bonus for every completed knowledge track tied to creative assets.
