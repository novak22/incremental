# Upgrade Hub Revamp

**Purpose**
- Give players a narrative snapshot of their reinvestment plan and surface ready-to-buy picks without hunting through a flat list.
- Group upgrades into themed lanes so the growing catalog still feels intentional and approachable.
- Celebrate momentum by highlighting owned and ready upgrades in one glanceable dashboard.

**Highlights**
- New "Upgrade roadmap" panel tallies owned and ready-to-buy upgrades while explaining the next suggested action.
- Category chips and sectioned layouts cluster upgrades into unlocks, boosts, and support lanes with per-section availability notes.
- Ready upgrades automatically populate the dock with their current label and price for one-click purchasing.
- Each card now carries tag/status badges, refreshed copy, and rotating detail bullets that stay current with game state.

## Structured taxonomy & stacking (Update)
- Tech, House, Infra, and Support tabs organise the catalog into breezy, high-level lanes so players can zero in on the gear they crave.
- Family groupings (phone rigs, workflow suites, automation, and more) now sit inside each category, clarifying upgrade progression at a glance.
- The upgrade effect engine applies category/family filters for payout, time, and quality multipliers; bonuses stack multiplicatively with sensible floors to prevent runaway values.
- Slot-aware upgrades (e.g., hubs providing monitor capacity) surface availability hints directly on cards, ensuring consumptive upgrades respect capacity before purchase.

## Lane navigator & quick stats (Update)
- A sticky rail on the left pairs the category chips with a lane map, making it simple to focus on one upgrade lane or pan out to "All lanes" in a tap.
- Each lane entry now broadcasts total discoveries, owned counts, and ready-to-buy picks so players can triage sprawling catalogs without scanning every card.
- Family groupings render inside bordered pods with local counts and notes, giving the new automation and infrastructure tiers breathing room as more upgrade options arrive.
- The dock still anchors on the right, mirroring button states from cards, so the three-column layout keeps filters, catalog, and purchase-ready picks visible together.

**Player Impact**
- Players can filter by affordability, search, or category simultaneously, drastically reducing scan time for priority upgrades.
- The overview note reinforces short-term goals (buy now, meet requirements, or save up) so progression stalls are easier to diagnose.
- Enhanced dock interactions mirror the card call-to-action, reinforcing confidence that the purchase will behave as expected.

**Follow-ups**
- Persist category/filter preferences per session.
- Add inline tooltips for requirement blockers to reduce slide-over trips.
- Explore mobile stacking patterns once responsive breakpoints are defined.
