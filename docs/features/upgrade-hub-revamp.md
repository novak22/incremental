# Upgrade Hub Revamp

**Purpose**
- Give players a narrative snapshot of their reinvestment plan and surface ready-to-buy picks without hunting through a flat list.
- Group upgrades into themed lanes so the growing catalog still feels intentional and approachable.
- Celebrate momentum by highlighting owned and ready upgrades in one glanceable dashboard.

**Highlights**
- New "Upgrade roadmap" panel tallies owned and ready-to-buy upgrades while explaining the next suggested action.
- Category chips and sectioned layouts cluster upgrades into unlocks, boosts, and support lanes with per-section availability notes.
- Ready upgrades automatically populate the dock with their current label and price for one-click purchasing.
- Each card now carries tag/status badges, refreshed copy, and rotating detail bullets that stay current with game state.

**Player Impact**
- Players can filter by affordability, search, or category simultaneously, drastically reducing scan time for priority upgrades.
- The overview note reinforces short-term goals (buy now, meet requirements, or save up) so progression stalls are easier to diagnose.
- Enhanced dock interactions mirror the card call-to-action, reinforcing confidence that the purchase will behave as expected.

**Follow-ups**
- Persist category/filter preferences per session.
- Add inline tooltips for requirement blockers to reduce slide-over trips.
- Explore mobile stacking patterns once responsive breakpoints are defined.
