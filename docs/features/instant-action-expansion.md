# Instant Hustles & Daily Quality Limits

**Purpose**
- Offer more meaningful one-off actions and prevent passive upgrades from being spammed back-to-back.

**New hustles**
- Audience Q&A Blast — 1h → $12. Requires an active blog audience and can only run once per in-game day.
- Bundle Promo Push — 2.5h → $48. Needs two blogs plus an e-book.
Both log to daily metrics and warn when requirements or hours are missing.

**Daily limit system**
- Quality actions now track per-instance daily usage (e.g., Blog SEO can fire once per day per instance, cover commissions once per day, etc.).
- Disabled buttons display remaining uses via tooltip copy and friendly log reminders.

**Player impact**
- Quick wins tie directly to owned assets, reinforcing investment.
- Cooldowns encourage rotating through multiple quality goals rather than hammering one button, while the daily limit keeps livestreams feeling special instead of spammable.
- Daily limits encourage rotating through multiple quality goals rather than hammering one button.
