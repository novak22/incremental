# Instant Hustles & Passive Cooldowns

## Goals
- Give players more to do with their spare hours without waiting for long setup chains.
- Encourage ownership of passive assets by tying quick wins to the empire they have already built.
- Pace out high-impact passive upgrades so each feels distinct and plan-worthy instead of spammable.

## New Instant Hustles
- **Audience Q&A Blast** – 1h commitment that converts an active blog audience into $12 of checklist sales. Requirements update live to show how many blogs are ready to invite.
- **Bundle Promo Push** – 2.5h flash sale pairing two active blogs with an e-book, paying $48 instantly. The card highlights the need for two blogs plus an e-book so players plan toward the combo.

Both hustles log time and payouts to daily metrics and warn when the player is short on hours or requirements.

## Passive Quality Cooldowns
- Blog SEO Sprints and Outreach pushes now rest for 1 and 2 days respectively.
- E-Book cover commissions and review rallies cool down for 2 and 1 days.
- Stock photo marketplace pitches and dropshipping ad bursts require a 2-day breather before repeating.

Cooldowns are stored per asset instance, block the button state, and advertise their timers in the quality panel. Attempting the action early surfaces a friendly log reminder.

## UX Touches
- Requirement summaries now display the current active/required asset counts, keeping the hustle cards actionable at a glance.
- Quality action buttons list their cooldown duration and show a tooltip with the remaining days when disabled.

## Balancing Notes
- Payout values aim to keep Freelance Writing as the early-game baseline while rewarding players who invest in blogs and e-books.
- Cooldowns prevent rapid-fire spending of money/time on the same upgrade track, nudging players to rotate through multiple quality goals.
