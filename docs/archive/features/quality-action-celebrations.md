# Quality Action Celebration Events

## Purpose
Quality work now has a chance to spark a short-lived celebration event that rewards recent focus with a temporary payout boost. These upbeat streaks are meant to highlight the most recent quality push, reinforce asset fantasy, and add another layer of day-to-day variety without overwhelming the log.

## Trigger Rules
- Eligible actions: every passive-asset quality action.
- Trigger timing: when a quality action completes. The event system rolls immediately after usage tracking and can be triggered again on later days.
- Chance: 5–10% per action, tuned per asset/action combo so more intensive moves carry slightly higher odds.
- Duration: 1–5 days (rounded) depending on the action.
- Effect: +8% to +18% initial income modifier with gentle daily decay (−0.02 to −0.035) until the streak expires.

## Player Impact
- Players occasionally see celebratory log entries immediately after a quality push, reinforcing that their effort matters right away.
- Boosts are modest so core progression pacing stays intact, but the temporary lift encourages players to rotate quality work across their portfolio.
- Events use asset- and action-specific copy so each celebration feels grounded in the asset’s narrative.
