# Economy Tooling Archive

These scripts and exports supported the pre-quickref balancing workflow and were retired once the quickref + normalized dataset became the live source of truth.
They are retained for historical reference alongside the final `tuning_parameters.csv` export (archived 2025-10-22).
Run them only when revisiting legacy documentationâ€”the live economy now sources directly from `docs/normalized_economy.json`.
